Problem dmopc16c1p0 from DMOJ

"One summer evening, while curled up with her beloved Cheese-kun plushie, C.C. begins craving pizza. Although she would really like a large, extra-cheesy pizza, her stomach is willing to settle for anything. Without hesitation, she snatches up Lelouch's credit card and makes a very important phone call…

C.C. will be "absolutely" satisfied if the pizza she gets has a width of 3 units and an extra-cheesiness of at least 95%.
C.C. will be "fairly" satisfied if the pizza she gets has a width of 1 unit and an extra-cheesiness of at most 50%.
C.C. will be "very" satisfied with any other pizza she receives."

Input Specification:
The first line of input will contain a single integer  W(1 ≤ W ≤ 3), denoting the width of the pizza C.C. receives.

The second line of input will contain another integer C(0 ≤ C ≤ 100) , representing the percentage of the pizza covered in extra cheese.

Output Specification:
A single line containing C.C.'s satisfaction with her order in the form: "C.C. is M satisfied with her pizza".

Make sure your output matches this exactly, including any spacing and punctuation.

Here, M is a string describing her satisfaction, which will be one of: "absolutely", "fairly" or "very"."
